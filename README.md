# enviro-monitoring
This project is a simple environmental monitoring system designed to measure temperature, humidity, and air quality in real-time. The system utilizes a DHT11 sensor for temperature and humidity readings, an MQ-135 sensor for air quality measurements, and an OLED display to visualize the data. The readings are updated every 5 seconds and logged to the Serial Monitor for additional debugging and monitoring.

The project is ideal for learning about sensor interfacing, environmental monitoring, and basic IoT concepts. It can be extended for smart home applications, air pollution monitoring, or other use cases where real-time environmental data is needed.
